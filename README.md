# Info 201 Final Project
#### Group BF 3
#### Jarod Martin, Ethan Katnic, Abbey Moore, Rasik Parikh

Our group has created a shiny application for our final project which analyzes a data set allowing users to easily sift through it noticing outliers, understanding trends, and drawing their own conclusions. We worked with fivethirtyeight [data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hip-hop-candidate-lyrics) that is a record of hip-hop lyrical references to 2016 political candidates over the past 25 years, noting the artist, sentiment and subject matter of each line. The purpose of our project was to shed light on how the public opinions of the 2016 candidates have shifted over the years. Some visuals of our app include when candidates were relevant in culture, whether they were criticized or approved of, and what types of topics revolve around specific candidates (such as Donald Trump and money).  

To get to understand the visuals better, here is a link to our 3rd visual (Candidates Mentions Over Time). This graph is able to show all hip-hop references towards 2016 candidates over time and color codes the points of data based on what politician is being talked about. You can even hover over the dots to see who the artist was that wrote about the politician. 

If you want a better understanding of our shiny app code, here is a link to the ui file. We found it best to discuss what questions interested us about the data, then make our own visuals in seperate tabs. This kept the project extremely organized while also providing different perspectives when deciding what kinds of analysis our group found interesting. Hopefully this allows a larger audience to understand, relate to, and enjoy the app.  




After our groups analysis of the data there are a few key features we would like to point out: 


One of the more surprising conclusions our group was able to draw from the data after analyzing it was that Hillary Clintons mentions fell from 2007-2016, while Trumps mentions increased over this time frame. We would have expected both politicians to rise in relevance as the 2016 election approached but it appears Hillary Clinton was actually more relevant in 2007. 

Another key trend we found within the data was the rise and decline of poisitive lyric mentions versus negative ones. It's public perception that hip-hop lyrics have gotten much more negative towards politics but our data shows the bigger change relates to there being fewer positive comments. Although our second visuals regression shows negative mentions increasing by *approximately* 10% from 1995-2016, it also shows a **50% decrease** in positive comments during this time. This shows that although people might agree hip-hop lyrics are becoming more negative, the data really reveals that there are just a lot less posiive hip-hop lyrics relating to politicians.
