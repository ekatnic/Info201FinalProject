  Our app works with [this](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hip-hop-candidate-lyrics) data from [fivethirtyeight.com]("http://fivethirtyeight.com/"), which is a record of hip-hop lyrical references to 2016 political candidates over the past 25 years. FiveThirtyEight generated this data by scraping rap-lyric database, _Genius_, for mentions of candidate names.
  
**Interesting Trends:** 
- Sentiment has generally become _more_ negative, and _less_ positive over time
- The subject of **Hillary Clinton's** lyric references tend to be _more_ personal than other candidate's
- **Trump's** references were very _positive_, up until the 2016 election, when they became much more _political_
