# Info 201 Final Project
#### Group BF 3
#### Jarod Martin, Ethan Katnic, Abbey Moore, Rasik Parikh

Our group has created a shiny application for our final project which analyzes a data set allowing users to easily sift through it noticing outliers, understanding trends, and drawing their own conclusions. We worked with fivethirtyeight [data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/hip-hop-candidate-lyrics) that is a record of hip-hop lyrical references to 2016 political candidates over the past 25 years, noting the artist, sentiment and subject matter of each line. The purpose of our project was to shed light on how the public opinions of the 2016 candidates have shifted over the years. Some visuals of our app include when candidates were relevant in culture, whether they were criticized or approved of, and what types of topics revolve around specific candidates (such as Donald Trump and money).  

To get to understand the visuals better, here is a link to our (3rd?) visual within our app. This graph is able to show all hip-hop references to trump over time and color codes the points of data based on whether or not the reference was positive or negative. You can even click on the dots to see what the lyric was or who it was written by. 

If you want a better understanding of our shiny app code, here is a link to the ui file. We found it best to discuss what questions interested us about the data, then make our own visuals in seperate tabs. This kept the project extremely organized while also providing different perspectives and ideas when deciding what kinds of analysis our group found interesting, hopefully allowing a larger audience to understand and enjoy the app.  

Some interesting trends we noticed within the data include: 
After our groups analysis of the data there are a few key features we would like to point out: 
One of the more important conclusions our group was able to draw from the data after analyzing it was: 
(Rubric also says we can talk about ourselves if we need more filler).
